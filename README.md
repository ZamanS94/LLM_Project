Team: Oleg Tervo-Ridor, Sabina Zaman, Matti McGill
Date: November 2024

The Meal Planner app simplifies meal planning by providing personalized recipe recommendations based on user preferences, allergies, and available ingredients. Users can generate quick or custom recipes, upload pantry photos for ingredient-based suggestions, and access a real-time cooking assistant for guidance. Built with React and Python, the app uses Googleâ€™s Gemini model for recipe generation and chat-based assistance. The tool aims to make cooking easier, more diverse, and customizable for users of all skill levels.
